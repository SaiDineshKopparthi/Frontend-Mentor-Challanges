    - **ease-in-out:** The speed of the transition slows down at the beginning and end.
    - **0.1s delay:** The effect waits for 0.1 seconds before applying the change.

- `a` (links inside `li` elements):
  - `display: block;` ensures the anchor fills the entire list item.
  - `transition: color 0.3s ease-in-out 0.1s;`
    - The text color transition takes 0.3s, starts slow, speeds up, and then slows again.
    - 0.1s delay before the color change happens.
