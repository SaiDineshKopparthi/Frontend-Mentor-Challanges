## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

#### Mastering Flexbox Properties

I've developed a deeper understanding of **CSS Flexbox** and, in particular, the following CSS snippet has become second nature to me:

```css
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
justify-content: center;
align-items: center;
This approach has greatly simplified my workflow, making layout structuring much more efficient.
```

#### Improved Usage of clamp()

I have also gained more familiarity with the `clamp()` function and started utilizing it more effectively in responsive designs. This has helped me create layouts that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes without relying heavily on media queries.

### Continued development

- I will be customizing the website to better suit my profile.
- I plan to experiment with new color palettes and explore different color combinations to enhance the overall design.
