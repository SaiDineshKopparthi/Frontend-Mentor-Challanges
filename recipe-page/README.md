## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Using semantic HTML.
- New CSS properties
- Responsiveness using `@media` queries.

### Continued development

I will try to achieve fluidic responsiveness with `clamp()` instead of the current approach using `@media` query.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Semantic HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) - This helped me to get a start with semantic HTML
- [W3 HTML Table](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp) - This helped me to understand HTML tables even more.
