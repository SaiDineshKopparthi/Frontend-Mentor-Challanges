## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to implement a responsive design approach, making sure the layout is responsive across different screen sizes. I also explored the use of CSS custom properties to manage colors and styles efficiently, reducing repetition in my code. Flexbox helped me create a flexible layout that adapts well to different screen sizes. Additionally, I gained experience with hover, active, and focus states to improve interactivity and user experience on the site.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue improving my understanding of CSS Grid and how it can be used alongside Flexbox for even more complex layouts. I'll also focus on refining my use of CSS custom properties for better maintainability and scalability of styles. Iâ€™d like to get more comfortable with media queries and learn how to create more dynamic, adaptive designs for different screen sizes.
