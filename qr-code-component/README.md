## My process

### Built with

- SHTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox (CSS Layout Tool)
- Google Fonts

### What I learned
This project helped me deepen my understanding of **CSS Flexbox**. Although it's a simple project, as a backend developer who initially lacked much interest in frontend development, I found myself lost when trying to implement even basic designs. However, after some effort and exploration, I gained clarity on the properties and behavior of **Flexbox**. This understanding has motivated me to continue expanding my knowledge of frontend development.

### Continued development
I want to continue exploring the properties of CSS Grid to understand its potential for creating more advanced layouts. Additionally, I aim to deepen my knowledge of fundamental concepts like margin, padding, and other box model properties to refine my designs. While responsive design wasn't a necessity for this project, I am eager to learn more about it to ensure my future projects are adaptable to different screen sizes and devices.


### Useful resources

- [W3 HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) - This resource provided the foundational knowledge needed to structure the project using HTML.
- [W3 CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - Helped me understand CSS basics, including styling, layout techniques, and essential properties like margin, padding, and Flexbox.
